**Maintainer**: Simon Spannagel (<simon.spannagel@cern.ch>)  
**Module Type**: *GLOBAL*  
**Status**: Functional

### Description
This module produces reference histograms for the telescope performance used for tracking. It produces local and global biased residuals for each of the telescope planes, and if Monte Carlo information is available, calculates the residuals between track and Monte Carlo particle.

Furthermore, the telescope resolution at the position of the DUT detector is plotted if Monte Carlo information is available. The Monte Carlo particle position is compared with the track interception with the DUT.

### Parameters
* `chi2ndof_cut`: Track chi2/ndf for the track to be taken into account. Tracks with a larger value are discarded. Default value is `3`.

### Plots produced

For the DUT, the following plots are produced:

* Telescope resolution at position of DUT

For each detector participating in tracking, the following plots are produced:

* Biased local and global track residuals, in X and Y
* Local and global residuals with track and Monte Carlo particle, in X and Y
* Time difference between seed pixel and other pixels in a cluster for different cluster sizes and vs. the pixel charge

### Usage
```toml
[NAME]
chi2ndof_cut = 3
```
